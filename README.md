Smart Aquaponics System with Integrated Real-Time Fish & Plant Disease Prognosis Using Deep Learning
This project presents a Smart Aquaponics System that integrates Internet of Things (IoT), Deep Learning (DL), and automated sensing technologies to promote sustainable farming. It addresses critical agricultural challenges like water scarcity and disease detection in aquaponics ecosystems.

Features
Real-time Monitoring using IoT sensors for:

pH level

Water temperature

Dissolved oxygen

Acidity and turbidity

Fish feed level and water level

Deep Learning-Based Disease Detection:

Tomato plant disease detection using CNN

Fish disease diagnosis from Tilapia image data

Mobile Application:

Built using Android Studio

Provides live system data, alerts, and image-based disease prediction

Automation & Control:
